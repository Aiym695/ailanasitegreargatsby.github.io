    <p>F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <strong>The Great Gatsby</strong> is a novel set in the summer of 1922 in the fictional towns of <em>*West Egg*</em> and <em>*East Egg, located on Long Island, New York. It is a story about love, ambition, social class, and the illusion of the American Dream. The novel is narrated by **Nick Carraway*,</em> a Yale graduate and veteran of World War I, who has moved east to learn the bond business.</p>

<p>Nick rents a modest house in <strong><em>*West Egg, a wealthy area known for "new money." His neighbor is the mysterious **Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and enigmatic man known for hosting extravagant parties. Gatsby’s mansion is across the bay from **East Egg, where **Daisy Buchanan, Nick’s cousin, lives with her arrogant, wealthy husband, **Tom Buchanan*.</em></strong> Tom comes from "old money" and represents inherited wealth, privilege, and social arrogance.</p>

<p>Gatsby, we soon learn, is in love with Daisy. They had met five years earlier, before he went to war, and he has never stopped loving her. Everything Gatsby has done—accumulating wealth, buying the mansion, hosting parties—has been in hopes of seeing Daisy again. Gatsby uses Nick to arrange a reunion, and the two former lovers rekindle their romance.</p>

<p>As their affair deepens, tension grows between Gatsby and Tom. Eventually, Tom confronts Gatsby in a heated scene at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Tom exposes Gatsby’s criminal background—his wealth is built on bootlegging and other illegal activities. Daisy, overwhelmed and afraid, withdraws from Gatsby emotionally. She returns to her life with Tom, choosing security over love.</p>

<p>That same night, Daisy is driving Gatsby’s car when she accidentally hits and kills <em><strong>*Myrtle Wilson, Tom’s mistress. Gatsby takes the blame to protect Daisy. Meanwhile, Myrtle’s husband, **George Wilson*,</strong></em> devastated and manipulated by Tom into believing Gatsby was both Myrtle’s lover and her killer, shoots Gatsby and then himself.</p>

<p>Gatsby dies alone. Despite his wealth and popularity, almost no one comes to his funeral. Daisy and Tom vanish, leaving Nick to handle Gatsby’s affairs. Disgusted by the moral emptiness and selfishness of the East Coast elite, Nick returns to the Midwest.</p>

<p>In the closing pages, Nick reflects on Gatsby’s dream—to relive the past and recapture a perfect moment with Daisy—and how that dream was based on illusion. Gatsby believed in the promise of the American Dream, but in the end, it proved to be hollow.</p>
