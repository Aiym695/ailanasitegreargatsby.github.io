  <h2>Critical Reflection on the American Dream</h2>
  <p>The Great Gatsby stands as one of the most powerful critiques of the American Dream and its inherent disillusionment. 
  Through the tragic story of Jay Gatsby, Fitzgerald explores how the dream of wealth, success, and love, which promises 
  fulfillment and happiness, often leads to moral decay, emptiness, and destruction. Gatsby’s relentless pursuit of Daisy, 
  his belief that he can recreate the past, and his eventual downfall demonstrate the futility of chasing an idealized 
  version of the American Dream that is, in reality, out of reach for most.</p>

  <p>The novel’s characters, including Nick Carraway, Tom and Daisy Buchanan, and others, reflect the moral corruption 
  of the Jazz Age. While Gatsby embodies the optimism and ambition that once defined the American Dream, his failure 
  exposes the hollow nature of this dream when it is built on illusion and deceit. Nick, as the narrator, offers a lens 
  through which we witness the consequences of these ambitions. His growing disillusionment with the world around him 
  ultimately leads him to return to the Midwest, leaving behind the shallow and morally bankrupt society of East Egg and West Egg.</p>

  <p>The symbolic green light, the extravagant parties, and the social divisions between East Egg and West Egg all serve 
  to underscore the gap between the ideals of the American Dream and the reality of social inequality and moral decay. 
  Gatsby’s tragic end symbolizes the death of the dream itself, a dream that promises everything but delivers nothing.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, The Great Gatsby is more than a tale of unrequited love and betrayal; it is a sharp and timeless commentary 
  on the dangers of idealism and the unattainable pursuit of perfection. Fitzgerald’s novel forces us to confront the fragility 
  of our dreams and the harsh reality that, in the pursuit of what we think we want, we may ultimately lose what truly matters.</p>
