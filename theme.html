            <h2>1. The American Dream: Idealism vs. Corruption</h2>
            <p>At the heart of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> lies a deep critique of the <strong>American Dream</strong>—the belief that anyone can achieve success, happiness, and upward mobility through hard work and determination. <strong>Jay Gatsby</strong> is its most iconic representation: born into poverty, he reinvents himself into a wealthy, mysterious socialite in hopes of winning back <strong>Daisy Buchanan</strong>, the woman he loves.</p>
            <p>However, Fitzgerald shows that by the 1920s, the dream had become corrupted. Gatsby gains his wealth through <em>illegal means</em> (bootlegging), and his vision of success is entirely based on <em>materialism and illusion</em>.</p>
            <blockquote>"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us."</blockquote>

            <h2>2. Illusion vs. Reality</h2>
            <p>Fitzgerald emphasizes how characters in the novel live in a world built on <em>fantasy, lies, and appearances</em>. Gatsby fabricates a false identity... Gatsby loses Daisy, and his dream, built on illusion, crumbles.</p>

            <h2>3. Class and Social Stratification</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Old Money</strong> – East Egg (Tom and Daisy Buchanan)</li>
                <li><strong>New Money</strong> – West Egg (Gatsby)</li>
                <li><strong>Working Class</strong> – Valley of Ashes (George and Myrtle Wilson)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite Gatsby’s immense wealth, he is never fully accepted by the old-money elite...</p>

            <h2>4. The Hollowness of the Upper Class</h2>
            <p>The novel shows that beneath the glamour of Gatsby’s parties lies <em>moral emptiness</em> and selfishness.</p>
            <blockquote>“They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money...”</blockquote>

            <h2>5. Love, Desire, and Obsession</h2>
            <p>Gatsby’s love for Daisy is based on <em>obsession and idealism</em> rather than true emotional connection...</p>

            <h2>6. Time and the Past</h2>
            <p>One of Gatsby’s defining traits is his belief that he can <strong>recreate the past</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”</blockquote>

            <h2>7. Identity and Reinvention</h2>
            <p>Gatsby's transformation from <em>James Gatz</em> into <strong>Jay Gatsby</strong> shows the theme of <strong>self-invention</strong>—but built on deception.</p>

            <h2>8. Moral Decay and Materialism</h2>
            <p>The novel critiques a society more concerned with <em>status and appearance</em> than ethics, showing how that leads to isolation and destruction.</p>
