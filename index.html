        F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <em>The Great Gatsby</em> is a timeless exploration of ambition, identity, and disillusionment,
        set against the backdrop of the Jazz Age—a period of rapid economic growth and moral upheaval in 1920s America.
        At the heart of the novel lies one of the most enduring and debated concepts in American culture: the American Dream.
        Traditionally viewed as the belief that anyone, regardless of background, can achieve success and fulfillment through
        hard work and determination, this dream becomes both a driving force and a haunting illusion within the world of the novel.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through the rise and fall of Jay Gatsby, Fitzgerald examines how the American Dream, once associated with hope,
        self-reinvention, and moral aspiration, has been transformed into a shallow pursuit of wealth, status, and external validation.
        Gatsby’s relentless quest to reclaim his idealized past with Daisy Buchanan exposes the fragile boundary between reality and illusion.
        His story highlights how the dream can become corrupted when rooted in fantasy rather than grounded truth.
        While Gatsby appears to be the ultimate success story—rising from humble origins to fabulous wealth—his dream is ultimately unattainable,
        built not on firm values but on delusion and deception.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the same time, the novel reveals how different characters experience the American Dream in unequal ways.
        For the privileged elite like Daisy and Tom Buchanan, the dream is inherited rather than earned, while others like
        George and Myrtle Wilson find themselves crushed under its weight. As Fitzgerald contrasts glittering mansions with
        the grim desolation of the “Valley of Ashes,” he presents a stark vision of a society divided by class, where opportunity
        is not as equal or attainable as the dream suggests.
    </p>

    <p>
        In <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, the American Dream is not simply an ideal—it is a myth wrapped in illusion,
        a vision pursued by many but truly grasped by none. Fitzgerald invites us to question not only the dream’s promise
        but also the very values on which it stands.
